# Poharan Macro
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/DaRealFreak/bns-poharan-farm)  
Macro to farm the dungeon "Chaos Supply Chain" on your preferred stage automatically. While essentially still being a macro with just some color checks this can possibly get you banned though. Usage is therefore obviously on your own risk.

## Installation
You'll have to configure quite a few parts of this repository to get this macro to work with your ClientConfiguration.xml and settings.
But for the installation itself you only need [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/) installation.  
Execute the `main.ahk` for the main functionality. If your Blade & Soul is running as administrator you'll have to execute the `main.ahk` also as administrator. Else the script doesn't require administrator rights.

## Cheat Tables
For the macro to fully work, you'll need animation speedhack and the clipper. Those are **NOT** included in this project and probably won't ever be included, since they were not fully made by me.

## Configuration

### [config.ahk](config.ahk):
Here you can configure hotkeys for your macro. This includes hotkeys for Cheat engine keys or configuration for the preferred stage.  
I can't help with what hotkeys you want to use, just read the functions and decide yourself.

### [ui.ahk](ui.ahk):
The most important file to configure. This class contains pixel positions and color codes which are depending on your resolution and ClientConfiguration.xml.
Basically read the function name and the doc block to see what position you have to check with `F1`. `F1` will insert the relevant code at your current mouse position into your clipboard and you can just paste it.  
There are some exceptions to functions not starting with `Is`, but it's all about the UserInterface in that file and the coordinates of the UI elements.
You can copy those also from the code generated by the `F1` functionality.

### [hotkeys.ahk](hotkey.ahk)
If you want to change the macro hotkeys for the functionality you're free to do here.

## Usage
The default hotkeys for the macro are:
| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| F1 | Color Check at current mouse position |
| F2 | Start the farm macro |
| Numpad Dot | Reload the farm macro |
| Numpad Enter | Fully close the farm macro |

As mentioned above you can change those hotkeys in the [hotkeys.ahk](hotkeys.ahk)
